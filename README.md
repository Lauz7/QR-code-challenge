Firstly, I ensured that my html code was solid, and arranged in my preferred format. I then began working on my external css file. When doing this I worked on the mobile site first then implemented media queries to allow the site to be responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### Continued development

I plan to continue working on frontend mentor projects to put more of my knowledge into practice and increase my portfolio.
